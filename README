GOTMARC -- because $POPULAR_ARCHIVE hates us!
=============================================

A collection of scripts to generate a static mail archive from a
Maildir; intended to provide a public web interface for the Game of
Trees mailing list.

The dependencies are:

 - mblaze
 - imagemagick (to resize the got logo)


How it works
------------

The makefile uses mlist(1) to gather all the mail of the mailing list,
mthread(1) for threading and mscan(1) for parsing.

Then, two custom scripts are called in the same pipeline:

 - mexp: creates a separate HTML page for each mail, as well as the
   raw message/body parts and the attachments.  It's the heaviest part
   of the pipeline.  If a message appears to have already been exported,
   it will be skipped to save some time.

 - mkindex: generates the index and threads page.


Usage
-----

	$ make MDIR=/path/to/got/maildir

will create and populate a `www' directory with the HTML files.  Pass
OUTDIR to override the destination directory.

Every once in a while, the maildir should be synced (with mbsync for
example) and `make' re-run to update the archive.  gotmarc does
incremental updates to some extent so except for the first run, which
will take a while, updating the archive should be fast.

For use with httpd' `gzip-static' (or similar)

	$ make gzip

will recursively compress every file in OUTDIR, leaving the original
file intact.

repository) is in the public domain.
