- automatic linking

  would be nice to transform the URLs in the mail' body into clickable
  links.  Additionally, it would be nice to support the [n] reference
  syntax.  Maybe turning also commit ids into links?


- improve thread navigation

  find a way to show links to previous/next messages in thread.  (yes,
  *messages* since threads are trees there may be multiple next
  messages)


- show the original file name in the list of attachments.

  see for e.g. /mail/YSqwKz9bbMYM9fHW@benson.stsp.name.html
