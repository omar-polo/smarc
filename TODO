- generate URLs under a path, for e.g. example.com/foo/smarc/


- automatic linking

  would be nice to transform the URLs in the mail' body into clickable
  links.  Additionally, it would be nice to support the [n] reference
  syntax.  Maybe turning also commit ids into links?


- clarify date ranges

  Threads are sorted by their newest mail, so if an old thread gets a
  new reply it'll jump in the first page.  The date ranges thus can
  jump quite a bit when navigating backward/forward.  Is this OK?  Can
  we communicate it better?
