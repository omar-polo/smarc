- automatic linking

  would be nice to transform the URLs in the mail' body into clickable
  links.  Additionally, it would be nice to support the [n] reference
  syntax.  Maybe turning also commit ids into links?


- clarify date ranges

  Threads are sorted by their newest mail, so if an old thread gets a
  new reply it'll jump in the first page.  The date ranges thus can
  jump quite a bit when navigating backward/forward.  Is this OK?  Can
  we communicate it better?


- use UTC consistently

  msearchd uses UTC, while the rest of the UI uses the localtime of the
  sender.  In the mail page it is fine since we show the zone offset too
  but the index pages don't show that!
