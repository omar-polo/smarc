- fix `make gzip'

  should gzip all the files in /var/www/marc, and re-gzip if the
  original changed.  My understanding is that if foo.gz exists then
  it'll be skipped, which is not desired.  In particular the index pages
  should be re-gzipped every time as they change.


- automatic linking

  would be nice to transform the URLs in the mail' body into clickable
  links.  Additionally, it would be nice to support the [n] reference
  syntax.  Maybe turning also commit ids into links?


- improve thread navigation

  find a way to show links to previous/next messages in thread.  (yes,
  *messages* since threads are trees there may be multiple next
  messages)


- show the original file name in the list of attachments.

  see for e.g. /mail/YSqwKz9bbMYM9fHW@benson.stsp.name.html


- clarify date ranges

  Threads are sorted by their newest mail, so if an old thread gets a
  new reply it'll jump in the first page.  The date ranges thus can
  jump quite a bit when navigating backward/forward.  Is this OK?  Can
  we communicate it better?
